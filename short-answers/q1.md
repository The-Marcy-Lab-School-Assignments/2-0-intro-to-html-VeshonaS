# Question
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
Semantic elements are tags that make the content of the tag readable to the browser and screen readers. With non-semantic elements the content inside cannot be read by the browser.
# Teacher Feedback

Yup! The purpose of non-semantic tags is to group!
